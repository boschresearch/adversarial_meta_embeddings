This is the companion code for the experiments reported in the paper

> "FAME: Feature-Based Adversarial Meta-Embeddings
for Robust Input Representations"  by Lukas Lange, Heike Adel, Jannik Str√∂tgen and Dietrich Klakow published at EMNLP 2021.

The paper can be found [here](TODO). 
The code allows the users to reproduce the results reported in the paper and extend the model to new datasets and embedding configurations.

## Purpose of the project

This software is a research prototype, solely developed for and published as
part of the publication "FAME: Feature-Based Adversarial Meta-Embeddings for Robust Input Representations". 
It will neither be maintained nor monitored in any way.

## Setup

* Install flair and transformers (Tested with flair=0.8, transformers=3.3.1, pytorch=1.6.0 and python=3.7.9)
* Download pre-trained word embeddings (using flair or your own).
* Prepare corpora in BIO format.
* Train a [sequence-labeling](Sequence_Labeling.ipynb) or [text-classification](Text_Classification.ipynb) model as described in the example notebooks. 

## Data

We do not ship the corpora used in the experiments from the paper.
